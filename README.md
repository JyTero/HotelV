Hotel V is a hobby project of mine in which I’ll be slowly building a hotel management game with smart and individual characters. Player constructs and manages the hotel through a group of player-controlled characters. I’m currently building the basics for a utility AI which will serve as the foundation for most all characters within the game. The development happens within the Dev branch with main having anything semi-playable.
The inspirations for the project include The Sims 2/3, RimWorld and Vampire: the Masquerade.
Due to being a hobby project, documentation is sporadic and not stored within the repo.
